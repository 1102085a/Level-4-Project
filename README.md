#Level-4-Project
Glasgow university needs to update its system for student project allocation as the current one is beginning to become outdated. There are three main types of users for this system: Admins, Supervisors and Students. Administrators handle information for all users stored on the database, and are responsible for verifying projects and managing to matching process. Supervisors can subscribe to categories of projects, submit projects to categories, and have students assigned to them once projects are allocated. Students are (usually) locked to a single category for their level, are allowed to browse the projects and rank them in order of preference during allocation, after which they are assigned to a project and its supervisor. Project submission and allocation take place during overlapping time brackets, students should not be able to edit their choices before allocation proper begins. Supervisors may add additional projects to a category while students are making their choices. The algorithm for matching will be supplied for this project.
